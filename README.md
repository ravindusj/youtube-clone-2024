# 📺 YouTube Homepage Clone

Welcome to my **YouTube Homepage Clone** project! 🎉

I recreated the **YouTube homepage** using just **HTML** and **CSS**, focusing on keeping the design simple yet faithful to the original interface. If you’re interested in how YouTube’s front page layout is structured, this project provides a minimalist, clean recreation without any JavaScript or complex frameworks.
